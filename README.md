# tic-tac-toe

This is a project I completed as part of the requirements for the JavaScript course in The Odin Project curriculum. The goal was to build the project with as little global JavaScript code as possible and keep everything inside of factory functions / modules. In the end, that goal was accomplished!

I used four main factory functions for this project:
  - GameBoard (generates the tic-tac-toe board and the cells)
  - GameFlow (controls the flow of the game from start to end, keeps track of whose turn it is, scans the board for a winner).
  - Player (allows instances of players to be created).
  - DisplayController (all of the DOM manipulation takes place in this function).

I also added a feature to allow the user to change the color of the game board. This was not required, but I thought it'd be a nice touch. 

This project really stretched my current programming skillset. I learned a ton about organizing code in objects and I know this knowledge will be invaluable moving forward.
